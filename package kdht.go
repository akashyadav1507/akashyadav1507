//
// The routing table must be safe for concurrent access.  You may wish
// to utilize data structures from the sync package, such as sync.Map
// or sync.Mutex, to accomplish this.  You are NOT required to
// maintain any particular semantics for concurrent access (e.g., if
// InsertNode is called while a GetNodes operation is ongoing), but
// your implementation must not corrupt its data structures or crash.

// your project.  (It seems likely that simple mutual exclusion is the
// route to take, however.)
